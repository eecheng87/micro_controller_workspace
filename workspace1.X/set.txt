Description

The set directive is functionality equivalent to the equ directive except that
set values may be subsequently altered by other set directives.

Usage

Because set directive values maybe altered by later set directives, set is particularly 
useful when defining a variable in a loop

EX

area set 0 ; The label area is assigned value 0

Note

The value assigned by the equ directive may not be reassigned later
